#   INSTALL - ESX 	#
#####################

**Notes:**
-- If you use quasar-inventory ignore the items on SQL.
-- You need to go to qs-core/config/config_items.lua and install the items there.
-- You can copy the lines on Installation_QBCore.md line 9 to 60.

-- If you use ESX you won't have access to the store like you have in qb-core.
-- Therefore, all items, you will have to place in a store.
-- The items that are in the qb-core store are: **fishbait** / **fishbaitilegal** / **anchor** / **fogueira**
