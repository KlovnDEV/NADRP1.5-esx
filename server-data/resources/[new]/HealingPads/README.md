## :bookmark_tabs: **Description** 
This simple resource add markers in front of all hospitals on the map, where players can get healed by stepping on them and pressing a button (default is **E**).

By default, this resource is **Standalone**. However, if you are using [ND_Framework](https://forum.cfx.re/t/updated-nd-framework-addons/4792200) by **Andy7666**, you can detract money from players for using the healing pad.
To do so, simply set *UseND* to true in the *config.lua*. If you want, you can even set a custom price range.

You can also add more healing pads wherever you like and customize the markers and blips on the map.

## :bulb: **Features** 
- Simple and standalone
